- Summary:

I first followed the video tutorial when it came out so that I can get familiar with the ssh key portion of the assignment. I've had a GitHub for a while for personal side projects. But to be honest I've never used it properly or as intended. I've been able to commit files to other repositories through VSCode and manually.

So now that I have a basic understanding of the process of using the terminal to use GitHub it's a good feeling. I didn't have any issues setting up the repository or ssh keys and the commit of my lab files. But going through this assignment, and I'm not exactly sure why I was experiencing issues when attempting to push the files.

The error I got looked like `! [rejected]         master -> master (non-fast-forward)`. So I google it and found the found a highly voted answer on stack overflow (source 2) the full syntax commands helped. I don't exactly understand what 'rebase' means but hey it worked. 

After that issue was complete I took the time to fix some typo issues in the `README.md` file, and now I will push this last change of this .txt file.
